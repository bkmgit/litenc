litenc - light NETCONF session framer API allowing the user full control without going through any XML validation of the PDUs. litenc can be easily extended with wrappers doing more based on the simple core functionality see litenc_lxml.


The entire litenc API is composed of 4+1 functions:
* connect
* send
* receive
* close

** rpc - is a sequence of send and receive calls. Handy when you do not need the full control provided by send and receive.

to install it on Debian 10 use

python setup/py install

For short example check:

scripts/netconf_get - script connecting to netconf server sending <get> RPC and printing to the standard output the reply XML.
